# Weather Application

In this assignment I decided to use the OpenWeather API to build the application.

## Installation

* Firstly, we need to install the packages. They are all included in the package.json file

```
npm install
```

* Then, you need to take my API keys, or generate them by yourself and put into the variables.

* After that, we are ready to start the application.

```
npm start
```

## Description

In this work I used the leaflet for the interactive map, and the OpenWeather Forecast API for the daily forecast for 14 days. Also, I decided to use the EJS for layout and DOTENV for the API keys.
